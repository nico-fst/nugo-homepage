TODO: Download in the App Store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While still in the process of building the app, checkmathe.de is my vision of students and teachers coming together and start learning with the overhead of getting started converging to 0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the website, new students will be able to search for teachers by &lt;em>CheckMather&lt;/em>, an approach where students filter potential teachers by their expertise.
Students will also be able to book recurring tutorings or &lt;em>InstantCheck&lt;/em>s where we promise to provide a teacher within less than 7 days for emergencies - again filtered by the perfect teacher&amp;rsquo;s knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the iOS (and maybe Android sometimes&amp;hellip;) App, students will be able to view their last tutorings and to have quick access to tutoring materials like PDFs from their teachers. They will be able to book tutorings from anywhere and view pending payments. My dream would be an Apple Pay integration where students can pay on the fly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay stundet for updates :).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
